            <h1>About Me & The Hexterika Journey</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my professional space! I'm Sangsongthong Chantaranothai, an aspiring cybersecurity specialist and a versatile IT professional driven by a passion for continuous learning and problem-solving. My journey into technology has been a blend of formal training, diverse real-world experience, and a deep-seated curiosity to understand how things work—and how to secure them.</p>
            <p>This page is where I share the broader context of my career, my personal growth, and the philosophy behind Hexterika.</p>

            <h2>My Path to Cybersecurity & IT</h2>
            <p>My career in technology isn't just a job; it's a dynamic evolution fueled by a desire to make an impact. From formal roles as an **IT Technician at the Synchrotron Light Research Institute** and an **IT Support Assistant in the Thai Parliament** to my ongoing role as a **trusted IT Generalist for a multi-generational property**, I've consistently embraced technical challenges. These experiences have honed my ability to diagnose complex issues, manage diverse systems (from Wi-Fi networks and IoT devices to enterprise software), and provide clear, patient support to users with varying technical proficiencies.</p>
            <p>My pivot towards cybersecurity is a natural progression of this problem-solving drive. I'm fascinated by the intricacies of digital defense and offense, constantly engaging with Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, hands-on labs, and formal certifications to build a robust skill set ready for immediate application in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.</p>

            <h2>The Spirit of Hexterika: Breaking Free & Building</h2>
            <p>Hexterika is more than just a name; it embodies my commitment to breaking free from conventional career paths and leveraging my diverse skill set to create value. It represents my entrepreneurial spirit and a belief that a "jack-of-all-trades" can indeed master many things, especially when driven by passion and a thirst for continuous improvement.</p>
            <p>While **Hexterika Cyberlab** (my dedicated IT & Cybersecurity portfolio) is my primary focus, Hexterika as a whole encompasses a broader range of professional skills. This includes a keen interest in **Figma UX/UI Design** and **social media marketing**, which I continuously hone. These complementary abilities empower me to approach problems with a more holistic perspective, understand user needs, and effectively communicate technical solutions.</p>
            <p>My long-term vision for Hexterika is to build a platform where these diverse talents converge, offering unique and comprehensive services. It's a journey of continuous learning, adaptation, and proactive problem-solving, all aimed at creating meaningful impact.</p>

            <h2>Personal Interests & Global Outlook</h2>
            <p>Beyond the professional, I am a global citizen with a passion for understanding diverse cultures and experiences. My time as an exchange student in the U.S. deeply enriched my communication skills and adaptability. I'm actively learning Romanian and planning a permanent relocation to Romania, driven by both personal aspirations and a keen interest in its growing IT and cybersecurity landscape. I'm also open to opportunities across North America, the UK, and broader Europe, always eager to embrace new challenges and environments.</p>
            <p>My journey is about continuous growth, both professionally and personally, and I’m excited about the opportunities to contribute to dynamic teams and solve complex problems on a global scale.</p>

            <h1>About Me & The Hexterika Journey</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my professional space! I'm Sangsongthong Chantaranothai, an aspiring cybersecurity specialist and a versatile IT professional driven by a passion for continuous learning and problem-solving. My journey into technology has been a blend of formal training, diverse real-world experience, and a deep-seated curiosity to understand how things work—and how to secure them.</p>
            <p>This page is where I share the broader context of my career, my personal growth, and the philosophy behind Hexterika.</p>

            <h2>My Path to Cybersecurity & IT</h2>
            <p>My career in technology isn't just a job; it's a dynamic evolution fueled by a desire to make an impact. From formal roles as an **IT Technician at the Synchrotron Light Research Institute** and an **IT Support Assistant in the Thai Parliament** to my ongoing role as a **trusted IT Generalist for a multi-generational property**, I've consistently embraced technical challenges. These experiences have honed my ability to diagnose complex issues, manage diverse systems (from Wi-Fi networks and IoT devices to enterprise software), and provide clear, patient support to users with varying technical proficiencies.</p>
            <p>My pivot towards cybersecurity is a natural progression of this problem-solving drive. I'm fascinated by the intricacies of digital defense and offense, constantly engaging with Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, hands-on labs, and formal certifications to build a robust skill set ready for immediate application in vulnerability assessment and penetration testing.</p>

            <h2>The Spirit of Hexterika: Breaking Free & Building</h2>
            <p>Hexterika is more than just a name; it embodies a deeply personal journey—a **yearning for freedom**, a **firm decision to break free**, and an unwavering **commitment to pursuing a self-designed path**. It represents a deliberate departure from conventional norms that often dictate what one "should" pursue. Instead, Hexterika is about passionately embracing diverse interests and skills, knowing that each one contributes to building a resilient and fulfilling professional life.</p>
            <p>My philosophy is that by gaining proficiency in what I am passionate about, I can forge a career that truly resonates. Some of these skills, like my focus in **IT and Cybersecurity through Hexterika Cyberlab**, are being cultivated to become cornerstones of my stable career. Others, including my interests in **Figma UX/UI Design** and **social media marketing**, serve as valuable complementary skills that open doors to diverse opportunities, whether as primary roles or as dynamic side hustles. Regardless of their role, each skill and endeavor under the Hexterika umbrella contributes to a holistic and adaptable professional identity, reflecting my commitment to continuous growth and self-determination.</p>
            <p>This spirit of breaking free and building on my own terms extends beyond just career aspects; it's a foundational principle applied to all facets of my life, driving both my professional pursuits and personal aspirations.</p>

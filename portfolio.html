            <h1>Cybersecurity-Driven IT Professional | Junior Pentester</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Sangsongthong Chantaranothai (Hexterika, Gexter). I blend real-world IT support with hands-on offensive security training.</p>
            <p>I run <strong>Hexterika Cyberlab</strong> — my lab-to-client bridge — where I break and harden web apps, Active Directory, and cloud IAM labs, then turn findings into clear, remediation-first reports.</p>
            <p>Based in Georgia (EU time zone), open to remote roles and small, well-scoped client projects.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h1>Cybersecurity-Focused IT Professional</h1>
            <p>I work across core security and IT domains: offensive security, identity and access management, cloud configuration, and practical troubleshooting. I blend hands-on pentesting practice with real IT experience to produce clear findings and remediation-first recommendations.</p>
            <p>My work spans both red and blue team fundamentals — from breaking systems in the lab to understanding how to secure them in real environments.</p>
            <p>Based in Georgia (UTC+4), open to remote roles and security-focused IT positions.</p>

                <li><strong>Turning lab work into real-world style reports:</strong> clear scope, evidence, impact, and remediation — written like actual client deliverables.</li>
                <li><strong>Breaking and fixing:</strong> web app issues, Active Directory misconfigurations, cloud IAM mistakes, and real-world troubleshooting patterns from my IT background.</li>
                <li><strong>Explaining risk without fluff:</strong> translating technical findings into “what this means” and “what to do next” for non-technical stakeholders.</li>

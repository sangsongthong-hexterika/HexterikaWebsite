            <h1>👋 Welcome — I'm a Global SaaS Support Professional</h1>
            <p>I approach tech support like MMA: cross-trained, calm under pressure, and built for real-world complexity. My experience spans device-level troubleshooting, enterprise infrastructure, and security-aware SaaS workflows — with every role deepening my ability to support users clearly and confidently across platforms.</p>
            <p>From CRM sandboxes to Linux servers, I build and document solutions through <strong>Hexterika Cyberlab</strong> — my active freelancing and project environment for remote-first technical work. This site reflects that work in motion: production-minded, client-ready, and globally aligned.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>✅ My Journey: From Tech Support Generalist to Global SaaS Readiness</h2>

            <h4>📚 Non-Tech Degree, People-Focused Skills</h4>
            <p>I hold a B.Sc. in Sport Science with COOP internship experience, where I built communication, observation, and support skills — all of which transferred directly into IT service roles.</p>

            <h4>🏠 Early Technical Foundation: On-Call IT Support</h4>
            <p>From 2020 onward, I worked as an independent IT Support Generalist for my local network — providing hands-on support for Wi-Fi, printers, CCTV, and smart home devices. I handled setup, troubleshooting, and user training directly, and when issues required external service, I acted as a technical liaison between clients and vendors — translating needs, verifying solutions, and ensuring smooth resolution on my clients' behalf.</p>

            <h4>🏛️ High-Stakes Private IT Support for Thai Senator</h4>
            <p>Worked as the sole IT Support Assistant for a Thai Senator during the COVID-19 lockdown. Ensured seamless participation in daily political video conferences (Zoom/Webex) by managing all onsite tech. Coordinated directly with the Parliament IT team to test, troubleshoot, and align remote access with official platforms. Provided real-time support under high-pressure, time-sensitive conditions.</p>

            <h4>🏢 Enterprise IT Environment: Synchrotron Institute</h4>
            <p>This role marked my transition from informal support environments to a structured enterprise IT department — where I supported real infrastructure, internal users, and standardized operations across departments.</p>
            <p>Responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>🖥️ Setting up and maintaining end-user systems: Windows 10 installation, RAM and SSD/HDD upgrades, antivirus setup, and Microsoft 365 deployment — performed on-demand or as part of organizational upgrade cycles.</li>
                <li>🌐 Joining workstations to the organization's Active Directory domain for access control and user account management (no server-side AD administration).</li>
                <li>🧑‍🏫 Deploying and configuring <strong>Moodle</strong> on <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> hosted in a private government cloud, using Linux CLI for setup and updates.</li>
                <li>🎛️ Managing audiovisual systems for Zoom and in-person presentations in meeting rooms and auditoriums — including remote operation via AnyDesk and on-site preparation.</li>
                <li>🔌 Performing physical infrastructure tasks such as RJ45 cable re-termination, network testing, and organization-wide LAN infrastructure deployments.</li>
                <li>📋 Tracking device lending logs and performing asset support duties such as decommissioning, labeling, and vendor coordination.</li>
                <li>🌐 Briefly contributed to revamping the internal WordPress website before being reassigned to higher-priority technical work.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This role gave me hands-on exposure to both Windows and Linux systems, real-world infrastructure support, and internal cloud services — laying a strong foundation for SaaS troubleshooting and cross-platform technical support.</p>

            <h4>🧪 First-Step To Global Remote Work: Hexterika Cyberlab</h4>
            <p>Operating as a self-employed practitioner under the name <strong>Hexterika Cyberlab</strong>, I focus on hands-on technical execution across system administration, cybersecurity practice, and SaaS support workflows. This role represents my shift into deeper technical work beyond traditional support — emphasizing cross-platform problem-solving, documentation standards, and production-readiness for remote teams.</p>
            <p>All public-facing work completed under this role is listed in the project section below. I am also available for freelance engagements, with service details listed on my site's <a href="hexterika-cyberlab-services.html"> Hexterika Cyberlab Services Page</a>.</p>
            
            <h4>📜 Verified Technical Development</h4>
            <p>Earned key certifications: 
                <strong>CompTIA Security+</strong>, <strong>ISC² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)</strong>, and <strong>TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester</strong> (Top 3%). 
                <a href="certs.html">View all certifications</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h4>🌍 Remote-Ready & SaaS-Focused</h4>
            <p>My path reflects steady progression — from personal IT troubleshooting to formal enterprise support, then into cloud-based labs and SaaS readiness. I'm prepared for international remote roles that demand cross-functional support, cybersecurity awareness, and technical documentation skills.</p>

            <h2>✅ Why I Pivoted to SaaS</h2>
            <p>My technical foundation began in cybersecurity — through labs, certifications, and real problem-solving. But as I explored support-focused roles, I found that the parts I enjoyed most were directly tied to helping people: resolving issues, documenting fixes, and improving systems with a security-first mindset.</p>
            <p>That led me to SaaS — where speed, clarity, and trust matter just as much as technical depth. It's a space where I can have impact from day one, contribute to global teams remotely, and grow long-term in a role that balances service and strategy.</p>

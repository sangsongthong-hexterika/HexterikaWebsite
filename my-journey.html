            <h1>Clarifying My Career Journey: Navigating a Unique Path to Cybersecurity</h1>
            <p>My career path might appear unconventional at first glance, marked by diverse experiences that don't always follow a traditional linear progression. This page isn't about listing my skills (you'll find those detailed on my <a href="cyberlab.html">Hexterika Cyberlab</a> and general skills pages). Instead, it's about providing context to the choices I've made and the journey that has led me to where I am today – passionately pursuing a career in cybersecurity and tech, specifically aiming for international and remote roles.</p>
            <p>I've always been driven by a desire for independence and a pursuit of challenging, meaningful work that truly utilizes my capabilities. This drive, combined with a series of life circumstances, has shaped a unique, multifaceted background that, while sometimes chaotic, has forged resilience and a broad understanding of various environments.</p>

            <h2>A Note on My Current Role: The Farm Manager Position</h2>
            <p>You'll notice my most recent position listed as a **Farm Manager (November 2023 - Present)**. I want to clarify the nature of this role upfront. This position, working for my family's start-up, primarily serves as a **temporary financial bridge**. While I am committed to my responsibilities here, my long-term passion and career goals are firmly rooted in the **tech industry**, particularly in cybersecurity, and securing an international, remote role. This farm experience is a means to gain financial stability as I actively work towards transitioning into a new professional chapter that aligns with my true aspirations.</p>

            <h2>My Path Less Traveled: From Academia to Entrepreneurial Endeavors</h2>
            <p>My academic journey began with a **Bachelor's Degree in Sport Science (July 2016 - March 2020)**. While I appreciated the field, it wasn't a passion I sought to pursue professionally. This decision was influenced by external pressures, rather than a strong personal inclination. Prior to this, I briefly explored **Law School at Thammasat University (2013 - 2015)**. This period, unfortunately, was marked by significant personal challenges that led to a necessary break for my mental health, highlighting the importance of well-being in my life.</p>
            <p>The earliest, and arguably most impactful, experience that shaped my yearning for international opportunities was my time as an **Exchange Student in the USA (2011 - 2012)**. This period remains a high point in my life, solidifying my desire to work in an environment where my English fluency is utilized and where I can contribute on a global scale.</p>

            <h2>The Bridge Between Worlds: Gaining Experience in Unconventional Roles</h2>
            <p>My transition into the professional world didn't follow a straight line. I found myself in roles that, on paper, could seem disparate but were critical in shaping my adaptability and problem-solving skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>IT Support Generalist & Collaborator (March 2020 - May 2025)</h3>
                    <p>This **self-employed role** was a crucial training ground where I acquired a broad range of **IT support and generalist skills**. I became the go-to person for all tech-related issues in a multi-building property with over 10 people. My responsibilities included troubleshooting Wi-Fi, printers, and various smart devices (smart TVs, wearable IoT, smart refrigerators). I also collaborated with internet service providers and even a solar panel company to manage network connections to converters across multiple buildings. This hands-on experience, though informal, provided a robust foundation in IT troubleshooting and user support.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Parliament Job: IT Support / Health Care Specialist (March/April 2020 - May 2024)</h3>
                    <p>This role was a study in contrasts. While my official title was a "Health Care Specialist Advisor" to a senator, my day-to-day responsibilities were predominantly **IT Support**. I managed Wi-Fi, printers, and video conferencing – a crucial function, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This position provided practical, hands-on IT experience in a high-stakes, demanding environment. However, its part-time nature, low pay, and the disconnect from my long-term career aspirations ultimately led me to seek new opportunities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Synchrotron Light Research Institute: IT Technician (October 2022 - October 2023)</h3>
                    <p>This was my first and most traditional IT role, offering valuable experience in a semi-governmental scientific institution. While it provided technical exposure, factors such as its domestic (Thailand-based) nature, on-site requirement, and limited growth potential as a contract employee meant it couldn't fully align with my ambitions for an international, remote career. The decision to leave, while financially challenging, was a necessary step for my mental well-being and to pivot towards roles that better fit my long-term vision.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Freelancing on Fiverr, Upwork, and Preply (2024 - 2025)</h3>
                    <p>These were attempts to quickly generate income through various freelance platforms. Though they didn't provide stable earnings, they contributed to my understanding of independent work and project management, which I've now streamlined under a new business structure.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Forging My Own Path: Self-Directed Learning & Entrepreneurial Ventures</h2>
            <p>Recognizing the need to proactively shape my career, I've embarked on several **self-directed initiatives**, often overlapping with the roles above:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Engineering Program with Carleton University (Canada) (March/April/May 2020 - sometime before October 2022)</h3>
                    <p>My attempt to pursue an engineering degree was cut short when the program unexpectedly moved online due to COVID-19. This, combined with growing financial and mental health challenges, led to my withdrawal, but it underscored my drive for advanced learning.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Hexterika Cyberlab Company (Feb 2023 - Present)</h3>
                    <p>This **self-employed initiative**, born from advice to formalize my self-study, is where I diligently hone my IT and cybersecurity skills. It's a dedicated platform to showcase my intense technical learning and practical application, treated with the seriousness of a full-time role. My journey here began with achieving my TryHackMe Jr Pentester certification.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Hexterika-Breaks-Free company (May 2025 - Present)</h3>
                    <p>Building on the concept of Hexterika Cyberlab, this **umbrella company** streamlines my various freelance endeavors across platforms like Preply, Fiverr, and Upwork. It serves as a unified brand for all my **self-employed work**, demonstrating my entrepreneurial spirit and ability to manage diverse projects, both technical and non-technical.</p>
                </li>

            <h2>The Underlying Drive: A Clear Vision for the Future</h2>
            <p>My career trajectory, while appearing varied, is underpinned by a consistent drive: to secure an impactful, international, and remote role within the tech industry, particularly in cybersecurity. The experiences outlined above, from the demands of IT support in unconventional settings to the resilience built through personal challenges, have all contributed to a unique skill set and a strong resolve.</p>
            <p>I am seeking opportunities where I can apply my growing technical expertise, utilize my fluency in English, and thrive in a dynamic, international environment. My diverse background has equipped me with unparalleled adaptability, a strong problem-solving mindset, and the determination to achieve my professional aspirations.</p>

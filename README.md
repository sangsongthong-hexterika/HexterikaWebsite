# Hexterika Website

This project contains the structure and content for the official Hexterika website. The website is split into several key sections, each representing a service provided by Hexterika. The main goal of this repository is to showcase the services, including cybersecurity, design, and marketing, while providing easy navigation between them.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Service Pages

**Landing Page (`index.html`):** The homepage of the website that serves as an introduction to Hexterika, linking visitors to the other service pages.

**Hexterika Cyberlab (`cyberlab.html`):** This page details the cybersecurity services offered, with links to GitHub repositories and documentation.

**Hexterika marketing (`marketing.html`):** This page explains the social media marketing services, including future projects and relevant case studies.

## Assets Folder

The `assets` folder contains all static resources used by the website:

`css/`: Contains all CSS files for styling the website.

`images/`: Folder for all image assets, divided by service. Each service has its own folder for easy organization of images related to that specific service.

`js/`: Contains JavaScript files used for interactivity, such as hover effects and any other dynamic elements of the website.

## Future Updates

This project will continue to evolve, with more services and improvements added over time.

At the moment, I am focusing on building a clean structure for easy scalability.

            <h1>Hexterika Cyberlab Services</h1>
            <p>Hexterica CyberLab is a freelance business offering cybersecurity consulting (including penetration testing), technical support, and remote digital services. While my local work focuses on IT and technical support, my online services are expanding into cybersecurity, web security assessments, and client-focused consulting.</p>
            <p>This business operates as a sole proprietorship under the name Sangsongthong, serving both individuals and small businesses. Remote projects are accepted through platforms like Upwork or via direct inquiry through the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page., while cybersecurity education services are available on Preply.</p>
            <p>The brand and its associated website are currently in a transitional phase, with the intention to scale from local freelancing into international cybersecurity and SaaS-related roles.</p>

            <h2>Sample Works</h2>
            <p>Below is a sample penetration testing report I created to demonstrate the format and depth of analysis clients can expect. It reflects my approach to identifying vulnerabilities and providing actionable remediation steps. This report is hosted on my GitHub repository and is periodically updated to reflect improvements in my methodology and reporting style.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>Hexterica Cyberlab is a hybrid professional platform that showcases my cybersecurity work both as a freelance consultant and as a portfolio for remote job applications. My current income comes primarily from local, on-site technical support services in Thailand, while I actively transition to international, remote rolesâ€”especially in SaaS environments. This site is part of that transition and reflects both my freelance offerings and my broader professional journey.</p>

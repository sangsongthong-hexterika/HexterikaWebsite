            <h1>Hexterika Cyberlab Services</h1>
            <p>Hexterica CyberLab is a freelance business offering cybersecurity consulting (including penetration testing), technical support, and remote digital services. While my local work focuses on IT and technical support, my online services are expanding into cybersecurity, web security assessments, and client-focused consulting.</p>
            <p>This business operates as a sole proprietorship under the name Sangsongthong, serving both individuals and small businesses. Remote projects are accepted through platforms like Upwork or via direct inquiry through the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page., while cybersecurity education services are available on Preply.</p>
            <p>The brand and its associated website are currently in a transitional phase, with the intention to scale from local freelancing into international cybersecurity and SaaS-related roles.</p>

            <h2>Sample Works</h2>
            <p>Below is a sample penetration testing report I created to demonstrate the format and depth of analysis clients can expect. It reflects my approach to identifying vulnerabilities and providing actionable remediation steps. This report is hosted on my GitHub repository and is periodically updated to reflect improvements in my methodology and reporting style.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>This website serves both as a portfolio for remote job applications and as the business front for my freelance services. I'm currently transitioning from earning primarily through local on-site technical support to building a fully remote career. While cybersecurity remains the core of my expertise and portfolio, I'm leveraging SaaS-related roles as an accessible gateway into remote work. For clients seeking independent, project-based support, I also offer freelance cybersecurity and tech services through this site.</p>
            <p>You may also come across non-IT and non-cybersecurity skills and services on this website. These represent secondary areas I've explored—often out of necessity during unstable periods—and are not the core of my long-term professional focus.</p>
            <p>Any services or content outside of cybersecurity and IT are grouped together under a general non-IT category, which is intentionally kept distinct from Hexterika Cyberlab to reflect their secondary role in my professional focus.</p>

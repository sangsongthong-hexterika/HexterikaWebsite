        <!--Relocation To Romania-->
        <section>
            <h2>Location & Availability: Remote & Globally Flexible</h2>
            <p>My <strong>#1 priority</strong> is securing an <strong class="key-statement">immediate remote position</strong> with a forward-thinking organization, <strong class="key-statement">regardless of geographic location</strong>. I am highly adaptable across various time zones and committed to contributing effectively from day one. My goal is to land a role <strong class="key-statement">within a month</strong> to support both my professional journey and personal goals, including a planned relocation to Romania by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>To provide clear information, I've ranked my priorities. This approach avoids giving the impression that relocation must happen simultaneously with getting hired, which isn't my intention. Relocation can take time, but securing a fully remote role can be much faster.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>#2 Primary Permanent Relocation Goal: Romania.</strong> My strong commitment to establishing my career permanently in Romania is fueled by profound personal motivation and genuine excitement for the local IT and cybersecurity landscape. I am proactively learning Romanian and diligently understanding the relocation process for non-EU citizens.</li>
                <li><strong>#3 Permanent Relocation Interest: North America (USA & Canada).</strong> I'm very open to permanent relocation to these regions. My prior experience as an exchange student allowed me to build meaningful personal relationships (non-romantic) there, and I'm keen to build my career where the IT and cybersecurity job market aligns with my permanent goals.</li>
                <li><strong>#4 Permanent Relocation Interest: United Kingdom & Broader Europe.</strong> I am also eager to explore permanent relocation opportunities in these regions to gain valuable international experience within the IT and cybersecurity fields.</li>

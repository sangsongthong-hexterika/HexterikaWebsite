                <p><strong>Hello, I'm Sangsongthong</strong> — a multidisciplinary professional passionate about cybersecurity, digital design, and technology. This website is both my personal portfolio and a gateway to my freelance services under the Hexterika brand.</p>
                <p><strong>Hexterika Breaks Free</strong> represents more than a name — it reflects my belief in breaking boundaries and building a career across different fields that inspire me. It's my personal mission and future vision wrapped into one brand: creative, secure, and adaptable.</p>

        <!--Core Focuses / Primary Focuses-->
        <section class="bg-2">
            <h2>My Primary Focus</h2>
                <p>My professional path is centered around two main areas that reflect both my passion and evolving expertise:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cybersecurity & IT</strong>--<a href="cyberlab.html">Explore Hexterika Cyberlab</a></li>
                    <li><strong>UX/UI Design</strong>--<a href="designer.html">Visit Hexterika Designer</a></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>I'm actively pursuing real-world experience in cybersecurity through VDP platforms like Bugcrowd, building on hands-on lab training to prepare for entry-level roles. While continuing to grow in this field, I'm also open to immediate opportunities — remote or relocation-based — in customer support, sales, or call center roles, where my communication skills and tech-savviness can bring value right away. In design, I'm confident in my UX/UI capabilities and currently refining my portfolio to better showcase project outcomes.</p>

        <!--Soft Skills / Transferrable Skills-->
        <section class="bg-2">

                <p>I bring strong transferrable skills developed through international experience, self-driven learning, and cross-functional roles. I'm adaptable, reliable, and effective in both remote and multicultural environments — strengths shaped in part by my U.S. Exchange Student year (see Education) and applied across support, sales, creative, and technical work.</p>

        <!--Brand Identity & Call to Action-->
        <section class="bg-2">
            <h2>About the Brand</h2>
            <p>
                Hexterika is the brand name I created to unite my services under one creative and strategic umbrella. 
                It represents a professional identity separate from my personal background — reflecting my values, journey, and multidisciplinary work.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Hexterika is my current brand, I also use the alias <strong>Gexter</strong> professionally. 
                Gexter is a persona I developed independently, blending inspirations from fictional characters. 
                While both names reflect structure and creativity, Hexterika embodies hope and transformation, while Gexter highlights my more unconventional, curious side.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not currently pursuing a legal name change due to the complexity involved, but these names remain meaningful identities for me.
                In the future, I plan to grow Hexterika Breaks Free into a full company that truly embodies this vision.
            </p>

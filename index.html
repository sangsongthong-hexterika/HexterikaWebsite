               I'm Sangsongthong Chantaranothai (my legal name). This site is built with two clear purposes: to serve as my professional portfolio and to present Hexterika as a freelance brand. Whether you're here because I applied for a role with your company or you're exploring the services I provide, this site is designed to guide you directly to what you need—no fluff, no distractions.

                Hexterika is the name of the brand. Hexterika Cyberlab is its specialization in IT and cybersecurity — my core focus. Everything else lives under Hexterika Break Free.

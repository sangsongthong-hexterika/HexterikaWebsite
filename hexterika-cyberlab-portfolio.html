        <section class="bg-1">
            <h1>Hexterika Cyberlab</h1>
            <p>Hexterika Cyberlab is my hands-on space to showcase <strong>practical work, technical support experience, and SaaS platform readiness</strong>. Launched in February 2023, it reflects the skills I've already applied across real systems ‚Äî solving problems, supporting users, and securing environments through action-driven projects. I'm ready to contribute in a support-focused role today, while continuing to build new skills that keep pace with evolving tools and threats.</p>
            <br>
            <!-- üöÄ STRATEGIC REMOTE PLACEMENT -->
            <p>While my past work has been primarily on-site, I'm currently focused on building a fully remote career. I operate from Thailand with a reliable setup, strong internet, and a self-directed schedule aligned with U.S. and European time zones. This alignment supports both my productivity and personal privacy, and positions me to contribute seamlessly across global teams.</p>
            <p>My independent work through Hexterika Cyberlab reflects this shift, where I've simulated client-facing SaaS support environments, documented technical workflows, and worked toward international standards. I'm ready for remote-first roles that value communication, adaptability, and technical depth ‚Äî and I welcome relocation sponsorship for long-term opportunities that match my direction.</p>
            <p>I'm proactively aligning my tools, time, and training to support users and teams across borders ‚Äî not just remotely, but professionally and consistently.</p>
